# Mod-2 FlashCards Starter Kit

This application is a flashcard game that can be played within a users terminal. Either arrow keys or number keys can be utilized in conjunction with the enter key to choose an answer from a multiple choice list. This application utilizes multiple classes and accompanying test files to display the benefits of test-driven development (TDD).

## Demo



## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
